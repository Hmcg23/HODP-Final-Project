# 📱 Exploring the Social Life of the Smartphone Generation

### What impact does digital media usage has on social comfortability and connectivity in young people?

## 📘 Overview

In this day and age, the presence of technology is continuously prevalent. Motivated by our own experiences with the positives and negatives of media, we sought to examine the impact that digital media usage, operationally defined as mobile phones, social media, and video games, has on social comfortability and connectivity on young people.
